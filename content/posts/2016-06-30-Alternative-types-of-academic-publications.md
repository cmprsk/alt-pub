## Introduction

Currently, the paradigm of scientific publication involves primarily the model of [peer-reviewed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review) publications. Dominated by a few companies and institutions, this model is based on scientific journals that publish in print, on the Internet, or both, works that go through a laborious selection of quality. Initially, an editorial board evaluates the overall quality of submissions, their suitability to the journal editorial line, its apparent scientific soundness, the general design and interest to the audience of the journal. After this highly subjective filter, the unpublished manuscripts are still sent to technical reviewers, usually people with deep knowledge about the area of the submission. At least two of these reviewers are commissioned by the editors. If both accept the task and approve the manuscript, it is submitted for publication.

The traditional academic publishing model is based on readers' journals, institutions (universities, governments, companies) and libraries that acquire paid signatures. It is an organized and highly profitable industry, as well as an effective oligopoly (1), in which the top five publishing groups control 50% of all publications and have a combined $ 10 billion in profit (1). This was not always a giant business, though. Academic journals are the main channel of scientific dissemination since the 19th century. Until World War II, however, they were mainly published by scientific societies. Only after that did the private academic publishing industry consolidate. Currently, most of the former publishers and journals of scientific societies have been acquired by private companies (1).

Several authors have pointed out that the academic _corpus_ represented by scientific publications is dominated by a group of western countries, and this _corpus_ is commonly referred to as **_mainstream science_**, whereas, in contrast, the rest of the academic world represents **_peripheral science_**. This arbitrary division can be roughly compared with the economic classification often identified as _dependency theory_ that divides the world into **_central (core)_** and **_peripheral countries_**. Thus, the current academic editorial model largely reflects the geographical division between _developed_ and _underdeveloped_ countries, using the World Bank criterion (2,3). This practice does not remain at this level only, down to a layer of institutions of **excellence** and up to the level of individual researchers, and serves as a positive feedback mechanism to maintain **hegemony** in the academic world (4). Briefly, _elite researchers_ in _leading institutions_ publish in the _most renowned journals_. The order can be modified randomly: the _most renowned journals_ are those where _elite researchers_ from _leading institutions_ are published. It is a self-referenced, closed self-centered model. Popularly, scientists refer to this rank of journals, institutions and researchers as _first tier_, _second tier_ and even _third tier_, terms closely related to economic power (5), but used imprecisely.

## Problems in paradise.

A number of problems afflict the peer reviewed publishing model. The bias imposed by the initial editorial evaluation is pretty obvious, but largely overlooked in discussions on the subject. The editors of a journal, as a rule, print its brand on the editorial line of the journal, often remarkably, however, not always impartially. It's really hard to imagine that in a scenario where there are thousands of scientific journals disputing among themselves a big market impartiality can be maintained systematically. The bias in scientific publications has a name: **publication bias** (5). It is often invoked when researchers from less important or peripheral centers can not reach the mainstream of academic publications almost exclusively based in developed countries. However, more subtle forms of "publication bias" are even more common, though less visible. Negative results, for example, rarely reach the top journals, as opposed to "revealing findings." The systematic failure to publish negative results seem to affect significantly, for example, the health sciences. Clinical studies showing results are easier to publish than those showing no effect of any treatment (7). Although such a complex phenomenon as publication bias is necessarily multifactorial and involves much more than the scientific journal editors, the latter are part of the "subjectivity" of peer-reviewed publications.

Another problem often pointed out is the lack of transparency in peer reviews. Usually, reviewers of scientific publications provide an *ad hoc* service and are not part of a body of consultant advisers. Moreover, their identities are usually unknown. There is, therefore, little guarantee that the chosen reviewers represent the field of the evaluated manuscript, let alone are well versed in that specific area of study. Furthermore, the peer review system is built to assess methodologically and scientifically the content of manuscripts, but not to detect fraud or misconduct. There are doubts and suspicions about the objectivity and honesty of each party involved in this process, both from the point of view of authors, and reviewers. Several proposals have been forwarded to try to remedy this problem (8).

The peer review model is economically dominated by publishers and journals that charge subscriptions and receive funding from government agencies and scientific societies (9). Almost all of the most important scientific journals are in developed countries and are published exclusively in English, also pointed out as a source of bias, affecting what and how they will publish. Publications in non-english national languages, even if they are among the most spoken in the world, are little read even in their countries of origin, in contrast to scientific publications in English. Although it makes sense for better international communication that there is a universal language, it imposes a necessary obstacle to scientists whose native language is not English (4).

## Open access

A recent alternative to the classical model of scientific publication by subscription is the [**open access**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access) model in which the publications are available for free on the Internet to be accessed and the cost of publishing is charged from authors or institutions. Scientific publication in Portuguese in Brazil, for example, is dominated by [Scielo](http://www.scielo.org/php/level.php?lang=en&component=42&item=1), a repository of open access scientific publications, funded by Brazilian government agencies. The open access model has received constant criticism of interference in the objectivity of the review process because the authors and institutions pay for research publications. Recent attacks disclosed the fragility of the peer review process in the open access model (10). However, it is the fastest growing academic publishing model and all major academic publishing groups today have their open access section.

The peer review and publication policies in open access journals are essentially the same as in traditional journals. As in the traditional model, the quality of reviews is commonly criticized, and anecdotal examples of errors exist innumerable (11). The proliferation of open access publishing houses and journals that publish exclusively on electronic media (which considerably increases publication speed and capacity) is also seen as a factor of overload in the peer review system, already weakened by criticism and difficulty in finding reviewers (11). In this way, open access has an image associated with a somewhat more fragile, perhaps insufficient, peer review. Objectively, there is no proof of this kind of idea, mainly because the revisions occur privately and there is no way to quantify or qualify them, much less how to compare the traditional model with open access.

From the geographical point of view, the open access journals have the reverse situation from the traditional model. Most publications on open access come from countries and institutions considered _peripheral_, outside the _core_ or _mainstream science_. One apparently paradoxical but important detail is that researchers from _peripheral_ countries (by World Bank criteria) with lower _per capita_ income are equally likely to pay for open access publications than mainstream researchers, who are often research funded (2). This is seen by some as indicating the greater permissiveness of the open access publishing system. In fact, a comparison showed that the open access journal _PLOS One_ accepted 70% of the submissions in 2011, while the hybrid journal (conventional publication alongside to open access) _Physical Review Letters_ published less than 35% in the same period and the traditional journal _Nature_ published only 8% (12).

A frequent criticism of the open access model is in relation to the amounts charged by authors or institutions for the publication of articles. Prices range from US&#36;399 (per author) in the PeerJ paper to US&#36;5,000 (per article) in the journal Cell Reports. In 2011, the academic publishing industry generated US&#36;9.4 billion and published 1.8 million articles in English, at an average cost of US&#36;5000 per article. According to analyzes, discounting the profit margin, the individual cost per article for publishing houses would be around $ 2700. For critics, this figure is artificially inflated and the cost, in fact, may be much lower. That would explain why a company like PeerJ can charge ten times less than others. On the other hand, experts in scientific publishing believe that PeerJ will not be able to maintain a self-sustaining and not much less lucrative business (13).

## Enter the Green Way

Alternatives that do not involve financial dilemmas or barriers to science communication have been proposed. A set of disparate publication arrangements can be grouped on the label **green open access**, where publications are available free to the public on the Internet, but publishing costs are diluted because there is no journal vehicle, replaced by repositories where the authors themselves "publish" or deposit their work ([self-archiving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-archiving)). These manuscripts (or other forms of academic work) are not peer-reviewed, nor pass the evaluation of an editorial board. Such repositories are mostly based in universities, although there are hybrid models where a company provides both open access services paid by the authors (also called **golden open access**) as well as a self-archiving repository. A number of different academic publishing types have emerged, with greater or lesser participation of mediators such as educational institutions, government and business. A popular scholarly publishing portal has as its motto: "credit all your research" and accepts submissions of any kind of academic material. Some internet services perform a general assessment to determine the quality of the material posted. Some services only publish the material after this evaluation. Other publish immediately any material deposited and only after perform an evaluation. This review differs from the editorial analysis of a scientific journal, being performed only to ensure the academic nature of the deposited material.

The recent proliferation of several different channels that allow the publication of academic materials not conventionally included in peer-reviewed publications shows the strength of the phenomenon. Collectively, these channels are part of the _Open Science_ movement, which seeks to _democratize_ access to academic information, reducing barriers to the free dissemination of ideas and research results (14). _Open Science_ can be seen as part of a broader political-academic trend, sometimes called _Open Philosophy_, which involves an innovative way of knowing and also a way of interpreting this new way of knowing 14). Yet an evolving term, the _Open Science_, has its roots in the movements of _free software_ and _open source_ of Computer Sciences and relies heavily on recent advances in the internet and the media. It is considered a _disruptive_ innovation in the sense that it tends to change definitively the way we do and disseminate science. The _Green Open Access_ road has the potential, unlike the most widespread models today, to truly democratize access to information and subvert the _core-periphery_ dichotomy that is at the heart of the academic world nowadays.

In the following sections, I will list several different forms of publication of academic material outside the traditional model and also outside of the _Golden way_ of open access.

## Green open access publications

This listing brings a non-exhaustive set of alternative academic publication formats, with examples from my own material, deposited in multiple channels. There are more and more ways and means of scientific dissemination, and this _e-manuscript_ (which is already in its fourth version) will continue to be updated periodically.
