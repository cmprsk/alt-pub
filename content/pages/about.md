# Alternative types of academic publications.

## What it is:

Project dedicated to share academic material in alternative formats. Aimed at the diffusion of the idea of ​​[open publication](https://pt.wikiversity.org/wiki/Manual_para_publicação_aberta_de_pesquisas), or _open access publication_, a branch of [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science), a multidisciplinary movement that seeks to modify the paradigm of knowledge production that centralizes and prevents its spread. Historically, Western tradition has become firmly rooted in the free dissemination of knowledge among peers. However, the concentration of investment in research, channels of publication and creative capacity around _closed_ institutions of production and publication of knowledge interrupted this tradition on a large scale. Diverse movements inspired by the concepts of [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) and [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model) have joined the still evolving concept of **open science**.

This page is not an electronic journal, or periodical, or open access publisher, or repository of pre-prints. Like the concepts that I want to defend, I designed this to be an alternative publication _modality_ itself. Project specs:

- It is a one-man venture (for now), but open to contributions. Its goal is to become **descentralized and community-driven**.
- No periodicity, shared material is **identified by versioning**.
- There will be no editoring, but a **minimal quality assesment for an unambiguous evidence base**.
  - Example: you will not see in this page texts about UFOs or _alternative sciences_ (the alternative of the page is the format).
- It will not have a peer review system, but will be **open to the free commentary, provided the [Comment Policy](https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines/) is followed**.
- There will never be monetary charges (but I will accept donations).

## How to use:

The information disclosed will always be made available under open licenses compatible with the **Open Science** movement, especially (but not exclusively) the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). No copyrighted content will be published, but citations may be made to materials so protected if comments on other publications are published. Plagiarism will not be tolerated.

## How to contribute:

Because the project is available in a GitHub [repository](https://github.com/fhcflx/alt-pub), the contribution process can be streamline as such. If you still do not have a [GitHub](https://github.com) (free) account, [sign up](https://github.com/join?source=header-home), open an [_issue_](https://github.com/fhcflx/cpc-neuro/issues/new) or [_fork_](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repository, add your content and make a [_pull request_](https://github.com/fhcflx/cpc-neuro/compare) to the project. In addition, there is the most usual way of contributing: send an email, or use any of the social networks that I made available. Finally, comments on the published texts are **very** welcome. Check the _Complete guide to contributions_. Give your opinion!
